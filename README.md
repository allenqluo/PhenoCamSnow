# Snow Classifier

`ResNet.ipynb` contains code to quickly train a deep learning model to classify images from a chosen Phenocam site. It also contains code for generating predictions on images from that same site. In that notebook, I provide two examples: one for the [canadaojp site](https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/sites/canadaojp) and one for the [vindeln2 site](https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/sites/canadaojp). 

To run the notebook yourself, first install the Anaconda environment described in `env-full.yml`. I also provide `env-short.yml`, which should allow installation of this environment across platforms. See the Anaconda documentation for more information: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file.

Then, follow the instructions in `ResNet.ipynb`.
